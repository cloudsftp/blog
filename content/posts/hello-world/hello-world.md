This is the first post in my blog.
It was inspired by a friend of my mother asking me to help with a static website.

First I turned him down immediately, but felt bad later.
At night, I then researched how to build static websites fast.
He wanted me to teach him, so I started with JIMDO.
I quickly realized, that these kinds of tools are not built for me.
They frustrate me a lot.

That's when I stumbled across [hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).
I think this is very promising.
Today, I then looked into hosting it on GitHub Pages.
It seems straight forward enough.
